AlfredEColiGeneFunction
=======================

Give a gene get a function!

This is a workflow for Alfred 2. 

Given a search term, such as a gene name or a functional tag, i.e. "ribosomal", Alfred will display all E. coli genes that have the term in their description or as their name. Selecting an item from the dropdown list will open the gene's EcoCyc page.

Currently, it cannot search for disjoint descriptors. It can look for search phrases that appear in the provided order such as "ribosomal subunit protein", but will not match sets of words provided in arbitrary order.
